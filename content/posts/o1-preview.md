**tl;dr** I used OpenAI's `o1-preview` model to code a web app that uses `gpt-4o-mini` to generate simple mental maths rules for converting between currencies.

Recently I was chatting to a friend in Columbia. An excerpt from the call:

> "I'm gonna buy something, is 8650 pesos a lot?"\
> "1 GBP is 5486 COP"\
> "Ok...that's gonna be annoying to calculate while out and about".

I thought about it for a bit and said "Drop the last 3 digits and divide by 5". 

OpenAI had just dropped `o1-preview`, so I wondered about using its superior reasoning[^superior] to generate such heuristics. Alas, I don't qualify for API access, so I [argued with 4o-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) until it made usable rules, and got o1-preview to implement it. 

The result is Mental Forex - how far my weird intern[^weird-intern] & I got in ~2 hours, when I hit the message cap. You'll need an OpenAI API key[^sus] to use it.

I've tried small projects with `claude-3.5-sonnet` or `gpt-4o` before, and this is a significant improvement. My early impressions:
- hallucination, gaslighting, and loops are much rarer
- it often followed all of the specified instructions
- without being asked, it tried to improve things along the way, such as the the prompts
- prompts have a much longer half life - it could remember, follow, and demonstrate that it followed certain instructions long after they were given.
- the abbreviated chain of thought logs are quite useful for understanding and telling it where it went wrong

I'm impressed. It needs hand-holding, but I didn't constantly wonder if DIY would be faster. Excited for similar capabilities from open-source models soon!
